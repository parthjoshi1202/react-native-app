# react-native-app

A number guessing game where a user can enter a number between 1-99 and the phone will guess the number which was entered by the user. 
The user can give a hint to the phone by telling whether it should guess a number higher or lower than what it guessed initially. 
It would also calculate the amount of turns it took to guess the correct number. This app was built as a part of my react native course on Udemy
